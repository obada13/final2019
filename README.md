I internd to make five separete markdown files, Each will deal with a separate sub_Populations.

The test and reseach is about a new  preventative aides (abacavirinol) under test in clinical trials. I will Analyze the effectiveness of this drug across the board. Consider population subgroups by gender, drug use, and sexual orientation. These research will consider five different Sub group, First Every body in the data group, DrugUsers, Gays, Guys, gays. Each will be analise by Graphical Descriptive Result, Numerical Descriptive Results, and the Inferential Results. with these methods we will able to determine the effectiveness of the new drug (Abacavirinol) on each sub-group.

$H_0$ There is no relationship between the use of new drug (abacavirno) and Sub Group contacting Aids.

$H_1$  There is relationship between the use of new drug (abacavirnol) and Sub-group contacting Aids, The drug is effective on population that took it.
 
### On Everybody in the Experiment the following Summery was analyze.
 
 The graphical resuit show effectiveness of new Aid drug (abacavirnol) on general population.  people that took the drug 40 percent of people that used the drug have Aids comparid to 60 percent of people that used the Placebo.
   
   Aslo Numerical Descriptive Results show effectiveness of new Aid drug (abacavirnol) on general population.  people that took the drug 40.89 was infected by Aid and 59.13 of people that used placebo was infected by Aids. this show that the drug is effective on people that use it.
   
   Inferential Results show that the new drug is effectiveness of Obsered counts treatment show that 423 of people that took part in the experiment have Aids comparid to 612 of the people with Placebo. Also the P-Vallue= 2.333. the  confidence interval:0.6295438  0.8148378, the estimated odds ratio = 0.7164774 compaired to ratio 1 to 1 when they did not take the drug. The New drug (abacavirnol) has relationship with Aids, it treduce the chances of been infected by Aids . So the new Drug (abacavirnol) is effective per the experiment.
   
### On Gal the following Summery was analyze.

The graphical resuit show effectiveness of new Aid drug (abacavirnol) on Gal(Females) population. that people that took the drug 31 percent of Gal(Females) that used the drug have Aids comparid to 69 percent of Gal(Females) that used the Placebo.
   
   Aslo Numerical Descriptive Results show effectiveness of new Aid drug (abacavirnol) on Gal(Females) From population of Gal(Females) that took the drug 213 was infected by Aid and 465 of Gal(Females) that used placebo was infected by Aids. this show that the drug is effective on Gal(Females) that use it.
   
   Inferential Results show that the new drug is effectiveness of Obsered counts treatment show that 213 of Gal (Females) that took part in the experiment have Aids comparid to 465 of the Gal (Females) that took Placebo. Also the P-Vallue= 2.2 the  confidence interval:0.3798342 0.5345407, the estimated odds ratio = 0.4511536 compaired to ratio 1:1 when they did not take the drug. The New drug (abacavirnol) has relationship with Aids on Gal (Females) Sub_Group, it reduce the chances of been infected by Aids . So the new Drug (abacavirnol) is effective on Gal (Females) Sub_Group per the experiment.
    
### On Gays the following Summery was analyze.
The graphical resuit show the ineffectiveness of new Aid drug (abacavirnol) on Gay(LGBTQ) population. that Gay(LGBTQ) that took the drug 72 percent of them that used the drug are infected by Aids comparid to 28 percent of people that used the Placebo. 

   Numerical Descriptive Results show effectiveness of new Aid drug (abacavirnol) on Gay(LGBTQ) population. Among people that took the drug 72.38 were infected by Aid and 27.62 of Gay(LGBTQ) that used placebo have Aids. this show that the drug is not effective on Gay(LGBTQ) that use it.
   
   Inferential Results show that the new drug is not effectiveness on Gay(LGBTQ) of Obsered counts treatment show that 76 of people that took (abacavirnol) part in the experiment have Aids comparid to 29 of the Gay(LGBTQ) with Placebo. Also the P-Vallue= 2.998. the  confidence interval:1.735490 4.369508, the estimated odds ratio = 2.720997 compaired to ratio 1 to 1 when they did not take the drug. The New drug (abacavirnol) has a positive relationship with Aids, it increase the chances of been infected by Aids . So the new Drug (abacavirnol) is not effective on Gay(LGBTQ) per the experiment.
   
### On Guy the following Summery was analyze.

The graphical resuit show ineffectiveness of new Aid drug (abacavirnol) on Guy (Male) population. that Guy (Male) that took the drug 59 percent of Guy (Male) that used the drug are been infected by Aids comparid to 41 percent of Guy (Male) that used the Placebo.
   
   Aslo Numerical Descriptive Results show ineffectiveness of new Aid drug (abacavirnol) on Guy (Male) population.  Guy (Male) that took the drug 58.82 were infected by Aid and 41.18 of Guy (Male) that used placebo were infected by Aids. this show that the drug is not effective on Guy (Male) that use it.
   
   Inferential Results show the ineffectiveness of the drug, Observed counts treatment show that 210 of guy (Males) that took the new drug (Abacavirnol) were infected by Aid and 147 of Guy (Male) that used placebo have Aids. this show that the drug is not effective on Guy (Male).   Also the P-Vallue= 6.596. the  confidence interval:1.240408 1.925729, the estimated odds ratio = 1.543902 compaired to ratio 1 to 1 when they did not take the drug. The New drug (abacavirnol) did not have relationship with Aids, it did not reduce the chances of been infected by Aids . So the new Drug (abacavirnol) is not effective per the experiment.
   
### On DrugUsers the following Summery was analyze.

The graphical resuit show effectiveness of new Aid drug (abacavirnol) on DrugUsers. that DrugUsers that took the drug 25 percent of DrugUsers that used the drug have Aids comparid to 75 percent of DrugUsers that used the Placebo.
   
   Aslo Numerical Descriptive Results show effectiveness of new Aid drug (abacavirnol) on DrugUsers.  Among DrugUsers that took the drug 34 was infected by Aid and 106 of DrugUsers that used placebo was infected by Aids. this show that the drug is effective on Drugusers that use it.
   
   Inferential Results show that the new drug is effectiveness of Obsered counts treatment show that 34 of Drugusers that took part in the experiment have Aids comparid to 75 of the DrugUsers with Placebo. Also the P-Vallue= 4.23e-08. the  confidence interval:0.2308342 0.5294225, the estimated odds ratio =  0.3534128 compaired to ratio 1:1 when they did not take the drug. The New drug (abacavirnol) has relationship with Aids, it treduce the chances of DrugUsers been infected by Aids . So the new Drug (abacavirnol) is effective on DrugUsers per the experiment.
